\title{Creates a Survey.Design object}
\usage{
make.design(transect.type, design.details, region.obj,
  design.axis = numeric(0), spacing = numeric(0),
  nested.space = numeric(0), angle = numeric(0),
  plus.sampling = logical(0), path = character(0))
}
\arguments{
\item{transect.type}{character variable specifying either "Line" or "Point"}

\item{design.details}{a character vector describing the type of design. See details section.}

\item{region.obj}{the name of the Region object where the survey is to be carried out.}

\item{design.axis}{user may provide the angle of the design axis but not currently used}

\item{spacing}{user may provide the systematic design spacing but but not currently used}

\item{nested.space}{the number of spaces between nested points. If spacing = 1 then all points on the systematic design will be sepected.}

\item{angle}{user may provide the design angle (only relevant in equal angle zigzag designs) but not currently used}

\item{plus.sampling}{logical vaule indicating whether a plus sampling protocol is used but not currently used}

\item{path}{pathway giving the location of the folder of survey shapefiles}
}
\value{
object of a class which inherits from class Survey.Design
}
\description{
Currently surveys are only generated within the GIS in Distance. If you 
are running a simulation in R you will need to get Distance to 
generate all the surveys as shapefiles in advance and supply the path to
the directory which contains these shapefiles and only these shapefiles.

The \code{design.details} argument should specify a character vector of either 1
or 2 elements. These options are described in the table below:

\tabular{lll}{ Transect Type \tab Design Details \tab               \cr 
               Line          \tab Parallel       \tab Systematic    \cr
               Line          \tab Parallel       \tab Random        \cr
               Line          \tab Zigzag         \tab Equal Angle   \cr
               Line          \tab Zigzag         \tab Equal Spaced  \cr
               Line          \tab User Specified \tab               \cr
               Point         \tab Systematic     \tab               \cr
               Point         \tab Random         \tab               \cr}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
data(transects.shp)
#Edit the pathway below to point to an empty folder where the
#transect shapefile will be saved
shapefile.pathway <- "C:/..."
write.shapefile(transects.shp, paste(shapefile.pathway,"/transects_1",
 sep = ""))

parallel.design <- make.design(transect.type = "Line", 
 design.details = c("Parallel","Systematic"), region = region, 
 design.axis = 0, spacing = 100, plus.sampling =FALSE, 
 path = shapefile.pathway)
