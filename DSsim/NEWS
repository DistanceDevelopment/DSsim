DSsim 1.0.4
-----------

Notes

  * Please note that currently objects in a population may only be detected from the nearest transect. This can sometimes results in edge-like effects if transects are located close together, e.g. with parallel random designs.

New Features

  *Uniform probability of detection in population detectability.

DSsim 1.0.3
-----------

Notes

  * Please note that currently objects in a population may only be detected from the nearest transect. This can sometimes results in edge-like effects if transects are located close together, e.g. with parallel random designs.
  * Please note that the heat colour have now been inverted by default to be more consistent with normal use. Red is now low and white is high.

New Features

  *Better plotting of density surfaces - now displays a grid with contours by default. There is still the option to plot the previous style (points) now with contours option.
  *There is now the plot option to fill the region polygons and gaps in the polygons with a specified colour. 

DSsim 1.0.2
-----------

Notes

  * Please note that currently objects in a population may only be detected from the nearest transect. This can sometimes results in edge-like effects if transects are located close together, e.g. with parallel random designs.

New Features

  * Added ability to save and load data generated from simulations
  * Added ability to run binned analyses
  * It now records the number of failed iterations
  * It now checks to see if there is a file meta.txt in the folder with the transects as this is a more robust way of telling it which transects belong to which strata
  * Now performs more checks on the density grid and makes sure that the required population size has been created
  * You can now provide multiple scale and shape parameters to generate a population with individuals of differing detectability
  * You cannow use adjustment terms in the mrds models
  * Added a glossary of terms for the output
  
Bug Fixes

  * Now catches ddf failures
  * Fixed bug in plot(density) and plot(region)
  * Fixed the way it checks for non-convergence in ddf
  * Fixed NA/NULL bug when ddf failed
  * Fixed bug when some strata have no indivuduals in them
  * Fixed bug when reps = 1
  * Added check for strata names to make sure they are unique
  * Added a function to fix shapefile generated by Distance
  * Updated the documentation
